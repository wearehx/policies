Hackers (HX)
============

This repository contains documents describing the content policy and administration policy for the [Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearehx/) Facebook group.

Our goal for HX is to create a community of hackers similar to the original HH, but to explicitly avoid the mistakes made in HH. Specifically, in this group we'll be focusing on only allowing quality content to be posted, so the group stays relevant to the topics people want to read about. To enforce this, and to create a balance of power, our admins are elected for a fixed term, after which the admins will be changed. In this way, more users get to become admins and be involved in the community, admins must behave in order to be re-elected, and the burden on admins is lifted, as it is only a temporary job until the next re-election. Furthermore, we will make heavy use of bots (which do not violate Facebook's policies) to enhance both the administration experience, and to allow normal users to help out with basic admin tasks and ensuring content quality. More details about our content policy can be found in our [content policy](content-policy.md) document.

Finally, we place a large amount of importance on transparency and accountability. More details on this, admin elections, the banning process, and more can be found in our [administration policy](admin-policy.md) document.
