# HX Content Policy

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the types of content that is acceptable in the [Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearehx/) Facebook group. Hackers (HX) is a bit different from other Facebook groups, so we'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute to read this.

TL;DR: Be civil, and keep posts relevant to hacking: creating and building new things, discussing things related to hacking, and celebrating hacker culture. Use the search bar first.

HX is an experiment. As a common trend, a community site that becomes popular will decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that by making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can prevent Hackers from falling into this trend.  We don't know whether this hypothesis is correct, but it has held up for a surprisingly long time already.

The most important principle on HX is to be thoughtful - civil and substantial.  Essentially there are two rules here: don't post crap, and don't be rude. Both types of posts will be closed swiftly, and if you continue to post them, you might be banned from the group.

An insightful comment can point out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned, perhaps from personal experience.  There's also nothing wrong with submitting a comment saying just "Thanks" if you believe it would be more polite than simply liking the post/comment.  That said, what we especially discourage are comments that are empty and negative: name-calling, derailing the conversation, spam, etc.

A crap post is one that does not genuinely add value to the community. Keep in mind that your post may show up in the feed of thousands of other members.  Posts on HX don’t have to be about hackathons, because good hackers aren’t only interested in hacking, but they do have to be something Hackers would enjoy or find interesting.

When having discussions, remember to respect each other and take the opinion of the other side  into account instead of name-calling or insulting the other person. It is okay to be offended, but it is not okay to be purposefully offensive.  We give everybody the same level of respect.

If a post doesn’t follow the rules, an admin will lock it. If an admin judges your repeated behavior to be intentionally against the rules, you may be banned. We’ll delete posts that break Facebook’s guidelines. See the Administration Policy document for more details.

## 2. What makes a post great for HX?

Note that just because a post is good, doesn’t mean a thread is good. If a thread devolves into a flamewar, it might be deleted or locked. Also note that reposting an on-topic post makes it a bad post and violates this content policy.

### 1. Announcements, hackathons, news

Announcements and questions (like "who's going to $x") about hackathons and events are great.

### 2. Discussions on technologies, tools, or hacker culture

Intelligent, constructive discussion about technology is awesome, as long as it is just that — not a flamewar. Please do a search before posting to see if similar discussions have already happened. If the discussion has already happened, please post your thoughts on the original thread. Otherwise, go ahead and make the new post.

Note that discussions about the way the group is being run should be posted in HX Meta. Please be civil with your comments.

### Celebrating personal projects, start-ups

If you’ve got a hack or project you want to show off, awesome! 

### What makes a post bad?

Don’t post irrelevant things or spam. Don't use HX to try and conduct illegal activity, get free things, or post your referral link. Politics are on topic, but *only* if it is related to tech. For example, if a politician makes racist comments, that is off-topic for this group. While topics like that are important to discuss, there are many other outlets for it to be discussed. A group for hacking and tech related topics is not one of them. 

### Don’t use HX as a Tech Support Forum

Don’t post something that is readily available online. HX is not a tech support forum, nor is it the place to go if StackOverflow gives you a negative rating.  There are specific subgroups for most technical topics. Nobody wants a bunch of questions on their Facebook feed.

### Don’t forget about the search bar.

Posts that can easily be found on Google, Yahoo, Bing, or AltaVista shouldn't be asked. 

### Don’t make overly vague/unhelpful posts

Vague posts pollute their comments instantly as people ask for more information that should have been in the original post. Include everything you would ask if you saw your post asked by someone else. If you're posing a question, try to respond to it yourself. If you need help, say what you've already tried. More importantly, make sure your question is evident: don't make people guess as to the meaning of your post.

### Jokes and Memes

Jokes in posts are fine so long as the same one isn't posted every day. Comments are largely unmoderated in this regard; repost away.
